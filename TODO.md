# TODO?

* Allow users to add custom logic to the server either via using this as a framework with custom hooks or via using this as a lib.
* Stronger transactional behavior. Perform JSON schema validation in transaction function?
* A query endpoint... It breaks the abstraction of this API though because of some of the translatations. Inclided to keep omiting it and have user directly query XTDB.
* More "List" filter support
* More conventional REST API features
* `codox` documentation
